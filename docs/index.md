# Welcome to FFTMatvec's Documentation!

This repository contains the code for FFTMatvec, described in the paper "Sreeram Venkat, Milinda Fernando, Stefan Henneking, and Omar Ghattas. _Fast and Scalable FFT-Based GPU-Accelerated Algorithms for Block-Triangular Toeplitz Matrices with Application to Linear Inverse Problems Governed by Autonomous Dynamical Systems._. SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing. 2025. To appear. arXiv preprint [arXiv:2407.13066](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13066)."

FFTMatvec is now performance portable to AMD GPUs and supports mixed-precision computations. See "Sreeram Venkat, Kasia Swirydowicz, Noah Wolfe, and Omar Ghattas. _Mixed-Precision Performance Portability of FFT-Based GPU-Accelerated Algorithms for Block-Triangular Toeplitz Matrices_. Workshops of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis. 2025. To appear. arXiv preprint [arXiv:2508.10202] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10202)."
